## About me
Hi, I'm Xenia, and now I'm working as a psychiatrist. This year I'd started working as a doctor and then realized that it isn't the way how I want to spend my whole life. That's why I am going to change my specialization from medicine to IT. Why did i choose front-end developing? Because I prefer to SEE the results of my work.

My career plans also iclude:
- an acquisition of work experience, 
- progress in actual front-end technologies,  
- learning frameworks, 
- improving my foreign languages skills.

During this year I wish to become a **Junior front-end developer**.
