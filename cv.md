## About me
Hi, I'm Xenia, and now I'm working as a psychiatrist. This year I'd started working as a doctor and then realized that it isn't the way how I want to spend my whole life. That's why I am going to change my specialization from medicine to IT. Why did i choose front-end developing? Because I prefer to SEE the results of my work.

My career plans also iclude:
- an acquisition of work experience, 
- progress in actual front-end technologies,  
- learning frameworks, 
- improving my foreign languages skills.

During this year I wish to become a **Junior front-end developer**.

## Professional skills
- **JavaScript versions**: ECMAScript 5-6
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: ReactJS (basics)
- **Backend experience**: Node.js (basics), Express.js(basics)
- **IDE**: WebStorm, VisualStudio
- **OS platforms**: Windows
- **Version control systems**: Git(GitHub)
- **Additional technologies**: Adobe Photoshop, Figma

## Code example
```
function isPrime(num) {
    if (num < 2) return false;
  
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) return false;
    }
  
    return true;
}
```
